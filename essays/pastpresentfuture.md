## My Past Before Computer Science
Growing up, I was mesmerized by different forms of technology. From the television, to my Nintendo DS, to computers, all I wanted to do was sit in front of these forms of technology and explore what I could do with these “tools.” Of course, at that age, all I could think about was how I could get fun out of exploring the world of technology. As I grew older however, I was mesmerized instead by the genius behind each website, game, video, and more. I was intrigued by how people could create such incredible things without physically creating something. I became curious about how this could be done and how I could create things myself.

## My Present as a Computer Science Major
Before coming into university, I had to stop and think about what I wanted to major in and eventually, do as a living. I eventually came to choose what I surrounded myself with my whole life: Computer Science and Technology. I decided on computer science in order to satisfy the curiosity that filled me up throughout my early years of life.

At first, I was very intimidated by programming and I constantly questioned myself with questions like, “Am I truly learning anything?” or “Am I way behind everyone else around me?” and most often “Am I made for computer science or should I switch to something else?” I was really distraught because I thought I couldn’t keep up with everyone around me and everything I was learning. Eventually however, I learned not to compare myself with those around me and instead, learn at my own pace, using the resources available to me in order to satisfy the curiosity I had and learn how to create my own projects and programs. 

## My Future with Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Programming
By letting that curiosity drive me, I now let my passion for learning and programming motivate me to learn all the nooks and crannies of programming. At this point in my programming career, I haven’t decided on a set pathway however, I am leaning towards software engineering because I believe that I can learn and practice all the aspects necessary to create and work on projects, which is what software engineering comes down to.
