Throughout this course, I've learned that software engineering is much more than just coding and web application development. It is a discipline that combines collaboration, structure, and ethics to ensure that technology performs its intended purpose efficiently. Among the several concepts covered in the course, two particular concepts stuck out to me: coding standards and ethics in software engineering. These concepts have changed the way I think about software development and computer science overall.  

# Coding Standards: Readability and Maintainability

Readable and maintainable code is critical for successful software development. Coding standards provide rules that allow code to be understood not just by its author but also by anyone who may work on it in the future. This course introduced me to tools such as linting, which detected mistakes and inconsistencies in code to ensure that it met these requirements.

The importance of coding standards extends beyond web development. For example, in a big team developing embedded systems for medical devices, simple and consistent code helps prevent significant errors and maintain regulatory compliance. This course demonstrated how adherence to coding standards facilitates cooperation and promotes long-term maintainability, regardless of domain.

# Ethics in Software Engineering

Another important topic taught in this course was ethics in software engineering. As technology becomes more influential in society, software engineers must examine the broader implications of their job. This includes concerns about data privacy, accessibility, and the potential biases built in algorithms. Reflecting on ethics has reminded me that software engineering is more than just addressing technical challenges; it is also about making decisions that are consistent with principles such as fairness, transparency, and respect for user rights.

The course taught me that software engineering is a complex subject that incorporates technical skills, collaborative strategies, and ethical issues. Coding Standards have stressed the significance of clarity and consistency in teamwork, whereas Ethics has provided me with a foundation for making sound decisions. These notions have provided me with a well-rounded viewpoint that I will apply to any career or personal endeavor.   Software engineering is fundamentally concerned with developing solutions that are not only functional but also responsible and impactful.
