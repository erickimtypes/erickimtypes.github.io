This project is an introduction to C++ and its object-oriented features, specifically focusing on the creation and manipulation of a `Complex` class to handle complex numbers. The program demonstrates basic class functionalities, including a default constructor, member functions to print the complex number in a formatted manner, and setter and getter methods to modify and retrieve the real and imaginary parts of the number. The main function provides a series of tests to verify the correctness of these functionalities, ensuring that the `Complex` class operates as expected.

The coding for this project was done using emacs on my Mac Terminal. 

The `Complex` class includes private data members for the real and imaginary parts, with member functions to set and get these values, as well as to print the complex number in a user-friendly format. This program serves as a foundational exercise in C++ for understanding class design, encapsulation, and basic input/output operations.
